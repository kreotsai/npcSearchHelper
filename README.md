# npcSearchHelper
A script to help search for items more quckly on NPC!

![alt text](https://github.com/kreotsai/npcSearchHelper/raw/main/img/top.png?raw=true)

Search Helper will put icons ON everywhere by default. 
To turn them off, edit the script, and change `true` to `false` for the area of the site you'd like to remove icons from.

For example, if I don't want icons to show at the Kadoatery, I would change line `26` of the script to
`Kadoatery: false,`
